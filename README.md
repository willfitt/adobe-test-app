TypeScript - 
    This was chosen because I prefer to work in TypeScript with type safety.
    I think it would be irresponsible to not use TypeScript wherever possible.
Adobe React Spectrum -
    I chose this for my component libary because it is what the prompt said 
    Adobe favors and I wanted become familiar with it. I am most familiar 
    with Material for React and Angular. I also chose to use the validation tools
    inside this library as well though I am most familiar with using React Hook Form.
